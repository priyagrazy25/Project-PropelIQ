# Business Requirements Document (BRD):

## Unified Patient Access & Clinical Intelligence Platform

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Executive Summary

This project develops a unified, standalone healthcare platform that
bridges the gap between patient scheduling and clinical data management.
By combining a modern, patient-centric appointment booking system with a
"Trust-First" clinical intelligence engine, the platform simplifies
scheduling, reduces no-show rates, and eliminates the manual extraction
of patient data from unstructured reports.

The system serves patients, administrative staff, and admins, providing
a seamless end-to-end data lifecycle from initial booking to post-visit
data consolidation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. The Business Problem & Market Opportunity

Healthcare organizations suffer from a disconnected data pipeline that
creates inefficiencies at multiple stages:

-   High No-Show Rates: Providers experience up to a 15% no-show rate
    due to complex booking processes and lack of smart reminders,
    leading to revenue loss and underutilized schedules.
-   Manual Data Extraction: Clinical staff spend 20+ minutes manually
    reading multi-format PDF reports to gather required patient data
    (vitals, history, meds), which is a primary bottleneck in clinical
    prep.
-   Market Gap: Existing solutions are fragmented; booking tools lack
    clinical data context, and current AI coding tools face a "Black
    Box" trust deficit where users must manually verify unlinked data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Proposed Solution

The platform is an intelligent, integration-ready aggregator designed to
improve both operational scheduling and clinical prep.

-   Front-End Booking: Delivers an intuitive scheduling experience with
    a dynamic preferred slot swap feature, rule-based no-show risk
    assessment, and flexible digital intake (AI conversational or manual
    fallback).
-   Back-End Intelligence: Ingests patient-uploaded historical documents
    and post-visit clinical notes to generate a unified, verified
    "360-Degree Patient View" equipped with extracted ICD-10 and CPT
    codes, transforming a 20-minute search task into a 2-minute
    verification action.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Core Features & Differentiators

-   Flexible Patient Intake: Patients can freely choose between an
    AI-assisted conversational intake or a traditional manual form at
    any time, with edits easily handled without forcing human
    assistance.
-   Dynamic Preferred Slot Swap: Patients can book an available slot
    while selecting a preferred unavailable slot; if the preferred slot
    opens, the system automatically swaps the appointment and releases
    the original slot.
-   Centralized Staff Control: Only staff members can handle walk-in
    bookings (optionally creating an account for post-booking), manage
    same-day queues, and mark patients as "Arrived". Patients cannot
    self-check in via apps or QR codes.
-   Data Consolidation & Conflict Resolution: The platform aggregates
    multiple documents to surface a de-duplicated patient view,
    explicitly highlighting critical data conflicts (e.g., conflicting
    medications).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Technology Stack & Infrastructure

To ensure a scalable, cost-effective, and maintainable platform, the
system architecture will be built utilizing the following technologies:

-   UI (Frontend) Layer: React
-   API (Backend) Layer: .NET
-   Data Layer: SQL Server
-   Hosting & Infrastructure: The application must be hosted on free,
    open-source-friendly platforms such as Netlify, Vercel, GitHub
    Codespaces, or equivalent environments. Paid cloud hosting services
    (e.g., AWS, Azure) are strictly out of scope for this phase.
-   Auxiliary Processing & Utility Tools: For any additional system
    operations, background processing, or data handling workflows, the
    platform must exclusively utilize strictly free and open-source
    technology stacks and tools.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Project Scope (Phase 1)

### In-Scope:

-   User Roles: Patients, Staff (front desk/call center), and Admin
    (user management).
-   Booking & Reminders: Appointment booking with waitlist
    functionality, automated multi-channel reminders (SMS/Email), and
    Google/Outlook calendar sync via free APIs. After booking,
    appointment details are sent as a PDF via email.
-   Insurance Pre-Check: Soft validation of insurance name and ID
    against an internal predefined set of dummy records.
-   Clinical Data Aggregation: Core 360-Degree Data Extraction utilizing
    uploaded clinical documents to build the patient profile.
-   Medical Coding: Mapping of ICD-10 and CPT codes based on aggregated
    patient data.

### Out-of-Scope:

-   Provider logins or provider-facing actions.
-   Payment gateway integration (provisioning for future reservation
    fees only).
-   Family member profile features.
-   Patient self-check-in (mobile, web portal, or QR code).
-   Direct, bi-directional EHR integration or full claims submission.
-   Use of paid cloud infrastructure (e.g., Azure).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   Security & Compliance: 100% HIPAA-compliant data handling,
    transmission, and storage. Strict role-based access control and
    immutable audit logging for all patient and staff actions.
-   Infrastructure: Native deployment capabilities (Windows
    Services/IIS) using SQL Server for structured data and Upstash Redis
    for caching.
-   Reliability: Targeting 99.9% uptime with robust session management
    (15-minute automatic timeout).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. High-Level Success Criteria

-   Operational Efficiency: Demonstrable reduction in the baseline
    no-show rate and a decrease in staff administrative time per
    appointment.
-   Platform Adoption: High volume of total patient dashboards created,
    and appointments successfully booked.
-   Clinical Accuracy: An AI-Human Agreement Rate of \>98% for suggested
    clinical data and medical codes.
-   Risk Prevention: Quantifiable metric of "Critical Conflicts
    Identified" to track prevented safety risks and claim denials.
